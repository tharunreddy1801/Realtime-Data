# ðŸ“¡ Real-time Ultrasonic Distance Data to Adafruit IO using MQTT and ESP8266
This project showcases how to send real-time distance measurements from an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) to the Adafruit IO cloud platform using the MQTT protocol with an ESP8266 microcontroller. The system continuously measures the distance of nearby objects and publishes the data to the cloud for live monitoring.

Using the MQTT protocol, the ESP8266 establishes a connection with Adafruit IO and sends distance data at regular intervals. Adafruit IO provides a user-friendly dashboard to visualize the data in real time using charts and gauges.

This repository includes:

.Code to interface the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor with ESP8266

.Wi-Fi and MQTT setup using NodeMCU(ESP8266)

.Integration with Adafruit IO using MQTT credentials

.Real-time data publishing and dashboard visualization

.Circuit diagram, sample dashboard screenshots, and code comments

This is ideal for IoT projects like obstacle detection, smart parking systems, or distance monitoring applications.
